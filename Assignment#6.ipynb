    "#Question 1:\n",
    "#Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\",\n",
    "#which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code,\n",
    "#in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects is an object's procedures\n",
    "#that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated \n",
    "#(objects have a notion of \"this\" or \"self\"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out \n",
    "#of objects that interact with one another.\n",
    "#OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes,\n",
    "#which also determine their types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Question 2:\n",
    "#List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Simplicity:\n",
    "#      software objects model real world objects, so the complexity is reduced and the program structure is very clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Modularity: \n",
    "#      each object forms a separate entity whose internal workings are decoupled from other parts of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Modifiability: \n",
    "#      it is easy to make minor changes in the data representation or the procedures in an OO program. Changes \n",
    "#      inside a class do not affect any other part of a program, since the only public interface that the external \n",
    "#      world has to a class is through the use of methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. Extensibility: \n",
    "#      adding new features or responding to changing operating environments can be solved by introducing a few new \n",
    "#      objects and modifying some existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. Maintainability: \n",
    "#      objects can be maintained separately, making locating and fixing problems easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. Re-usability: \n",
    "#      objects can be reused in different programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Question 3:\n",
    "#Differentiate between function and method?\n",
    "\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "#A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and\n",
    "#can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical\n",
    "#to a function except for two key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "# A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
    "# A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a\n",
    "#class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).\n",
    "\n",
    "#Question 4:\n",
    "#Define the following terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Class\n",
    "#      a class is a blueprint for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Object\n",
    "#      object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Attribute\n",
    "#     Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. Behavior\n",
    "#     The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are the functions and subroutines defined within the object\n",
    "#     class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Question 5:\n",
    "#Write a code in python in which create a class named it Car which\n",
    "#have 5 attributes such like (model, color and name etc.) and 3\n",
    "#methods. And create 5 object instance from that class.\n",
